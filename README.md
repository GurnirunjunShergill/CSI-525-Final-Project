left to do:

add delete functionality for: DONE
    - budget items
    - budget itself

add crud functionality for comments for owners and write-acces users on a budget DONE

all thats left is to add user access rules DONE
    should only have access to edit/add/delete on write access stuff
        budget title
        budget items
        comments


Have done:
User: 
    add/delete/update/view
Budget:
    add/delete/update/view: goal
    add/delete/update/view: budget item
    add/delete/update/view: comment
    all of the above is based on access




style better







then you're done

nice to have: 
- analysis view of if you're hitting your goals 
- daily: at least
- monthly and yearly are easier
- weekly is the hardest
