left to do:

add delete functionality for:
    - budget items
    - budget itself

add crud functionality for comments for owners and write-acces users on a budget

style better

then you're done

nice to have: 
- analysis view of if you're hitting your goals 
- daily: at least
- monthly and yearly are easier
- weekly is the hardest
